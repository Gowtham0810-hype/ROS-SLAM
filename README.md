# ROS-SLAM
using slam network for autonomous navigation of any vehicle/robot.
This project investigates the application of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in mobile robotics using the Robot Operating System (ROS). The objective of SLAM in mobile robotics is to construct and update a map of an unexplored environment while simultaneously keeping track of the robot’s location within this environment. The project builds upon previous works that have proposed mobile robot navigation control systems based on the integration of laser SLAM localization and real-time obstacle avoidance control. The methodology involves the use of the ROS Navigation Stack, a set of software libraries and tools that help robots move from place to place. The robot is moved using a keyboard interface or the “2D Nav Goal” button in rviz to specify a navigation goal. The map is built up as the robot explores the environment.The results demonstrate that the robot can successfully navigate and build a map of its environment using SLAM. The map updates in real time as the robot moves, demonstrating the effectiveness of the SLAM implementation..Themotivation for undertaking this project on SLAM navigation using ROS stems from the increasing importance of autonomous navigation in the field of robotics. As our world becomes more interconnected and automated,the demand for intelligent systems capable of navigating complex environments is growing. SLAM, as a fundamental technology in autonomous navigation, plays a crucial role in enabling robots to understand and interact with their surroundings. By implementing SLAM navigation using ROS, we aim to contribute to the advancement of this technology and its applications. This project not only provides an opportunity to delve into the intricacies of SLAM and ROS but also serves as a platform to explore the potential of autonomous navigation in real-world scenarios. The knowledge and experience gained from this project could pave the way for future innovations in mobile robotics.
